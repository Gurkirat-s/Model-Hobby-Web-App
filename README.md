## About This project

Model Hobby is a single page web application for an eCommerce site that sells model cars, planes, motorcycles, and etc. Built with a Nodejs backend RESTful API, the application queries products, and categories from a SQLite database. ExpressJs is used for a backend session based cart and to host the server. Frontend is implemented using HTML, CSS, SASS and React to dynamically display information.
